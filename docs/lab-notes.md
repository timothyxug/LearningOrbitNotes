# OrbitIdeaForge Lab Notes

- **2021-04-16**: Filled the `ideaFragments` collection with a balanced mix of web2 and web3 seeds. I wanted each entry to feel like a quick weekend hack note.
- **2021-04-21**: Added the generator logic that creates short prompts and wraps the steps into numbered notes. I kept the steps intentionally simple so the prompts stay flexible.
- **2021-04-24**: Wired up a CLI runner for quick idea surface. Running the script prints the whole idea so I can test new fragments without building anything fancy.

> The idea is to keep this log as a living record I can revisit when deciding what experiment to prioritize next.
