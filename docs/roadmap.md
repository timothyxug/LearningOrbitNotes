# Roadmap Sketches

1. **Idea tuning interface** — Build a quick page or CLI flag that layers additional tags (like "finance" and "bot") so I can nudge the generator toward dual categories.
2. **Export log drafts** — Automatically dump the generated prompt, steps, and timestamp into `docs/experiment-log.md` whenever I run the CLI for a new idea.
3. **Learning curve tracker** — Introduce a light CSV or JSON ledger that notes which fragments were explored and what short reflections followed.
4. **Share at end-of-week** — Format one of the prompts into a short personal blog-style recap for the weekend review.

Each entry above represents the kind of work I’d do during another evening session, keeping the commit history human-paced.
