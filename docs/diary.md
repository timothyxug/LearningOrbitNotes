- 2021-05-02: Added a quick report script so I could dump session data for later rereads.
- 2021-05-09: Added a couple of smoke tests to keep the prompts honest while drafting entries.
- 2021-05-14: Wrote down the workflow for using the report script after another late-night session.
- 2021-05-23: Added a tiny palette peek helper; it feels like a cheat sheet for deciding what to research next.
